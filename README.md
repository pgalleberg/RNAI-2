# RNAI Version 1.0.0

This document/wiki covers the documentation for the functionality of the RNAI content aggregation library built, the reference for the API endpoints deployed for web access of the RNAI library, as well as a refernce of the database schema for the resultiung data.

## Deploying the RNAI API and Backend

The current prototype deployment runs as a nohup entry, with the following command:

```bash
nohup python3 rnai_backend/main.py &
```

This process will be updated to run as a service in the future - with a VPC with private and public subnets and a direct integration to MongoDB via a private endpoint.

## RNAI Library

The RNAI library extracts and aggregate data from the Internet (in this iteration, exclusively from Google Scholar), and compiles a content library as a MongoDB database that can be dynamically acessed, modified, and/or enriched.

The following documentation captures the processes taken to described under topics for each component of the content library generated, as it relates to the process followed in the RNAI library to generate the content.

### Verticals

* The verticals RNAI processes essentially consists of a title provided from the admin/moderator being saved to the database, as curretnly there is little curating to the vertical record itself be done to the name of the vertical itself.

* The vertical creation procedure results in MongoDB assigning a unique ID to the vertical which is sued as a reference for records of papers created under this vertical.

* The subroutine for adding verticals is at the following [file](rnai_backend/rnai/verticals/add.py).

* The subroutine for ranking all paper records under a vertical is at this [file](rnai_backend/rnai/verticals/rank_papers.py).

* The functions in the [main](rnai_backend/rnai/main.py) RNAI library that are called relevant to verticals can be found at `initialise_vertical`, `populate_verticals`, and `rank_verticals`.

### Papers

Aggregating content for the papers is the core copmonent of the functionality of the current RNAI library.

* The starting point to building content for papers for a vertical are the initial set of paper titles provided in the vertical creation process submitted to the system.
* Using these, a first iteration is created by querying Google Scholar for the paper titles, and extracting the top citations.

* For each paper, the data gathered from Google Scholar are saved under the `rnai.bucket_papers` to reduce queries made to Gooogle Scholar to maximise efficiency.

* The citation retrieval parameters can be adjusted in real-time by dynamically updating the parameters in the database under the `rnai_deployment.cite_parameters`

* Records are created for each paper by referring to Google Scholar and gathering author details and citations of the papers, and based on the number of levels with regards to depth as configured under the previous steps, and the number of citations per paper for which papers are retrieved are used to complete the paper data exctracted under each level.

* The relevant subroutine for adding a paper for the collection of papers is at this [file](rnai_backend/rnai/papers/add.py).

* The relevant subrouine for extracting the citations dynamically for a given paper is at this [file](rnai_backend/rnai/papers/citations.py).

* The functions in the [main](rnai_backend/rnai/main.py) RNAI library that are called relevant to papers can be found at `create_buckets`, `process_papers`, and `rank_papers`.

### Authors

* After all the papers for verticals are extracted, author data is extracted from the paper data saved in the buckets collection and Google Schoalr records.

* The relvant subroutines for extracting author data are at this [file](rnai_backend/rnai/authors/author_ids.py) and [file](rnai_backend/rnai/authors/retrieve.py).

* The subroutine for ranking papers by relevance to the vertical is at this [file](rnai_backend/rnai/authors/rank.py).

* The functions in the [main](rnai_backend/rnai/main.py) RNAI library that are called relevant to authors can be found at `process_authors` and `populate_author_records`.

### Institutes

* Intitutes are extracted from the affiliation details within author record aggregation, under the function found [here](rnai_backend/rnai/authors/retrieve.py).

* The affiliation details found under authors are unstructured with regards to the role of researcher, research group and university/institute data, so Natural Language Processing functions are used to extract the institute data.

## RNAI Deployment API
